This is a small [Katalon Studio](https://katalon.com/katalon-studio) project for demonstration purpose. You can download the zip of this repository from the [Releases](https://github.com/kazurayam/StaleElementReferenceExceptionReproduction/releases) page, download it, unzip it, open it with your local Katalon Studio.

This project provides a few sample code which can firmly reproduce the Selenium StaleElementReferenceException.

I created this project using Katalon Studio v10.0.0 on macOS 14.7.1 with Chrome browser v131. But this project has no dependency to the katalon versions and platforms. You should be able to run this on any version of Katalon Studio on any OS using any browser.
